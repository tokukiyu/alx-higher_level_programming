## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0\. Print a list of integers <br/>_**[0-print_list_integer.py](0-print_list_integer.py)**_  contains a function that prints all integers of a list.
+ [x] 1\. Secure access to an element in a list <br/>_**[1-element_at.py](1-element_at.py)**_  contains a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
+ [x] 2\. Replace element <br/>_**[2-replace_in_list.py](2-replace_in_list.py)**_  contains a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
+ [x] 3\. Print a list of integers... in reverse! <br/>_**[3-print_reversed_list_integer.py](3-print_reversed_list_integer.py)**_  contains a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
+ [x] 4\. Replace in a copy <br/>_**[4-new_in_list.py](4-new_in_list.py)**_  contains a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
+ [x] 5\. Can you C me now? <br/>_**[5-no_c.py](5-no_c.py)**_  contains a function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.
+ [x] 6\. Lists of lists = Matrix <br/>_**[6-print_matrix_integer.py](6-print_matrix_integer.py)**_  contains a function that prints a matrix of integers.
+ [x] 7\. Tuples addition <br/>_**[7-add_tuple.py](7-add_tuple.py)**_  contains a function that adds 2 tuples.
+ [x] 8\. More returns! <br/>_**[8-multiple_returns.py](8-multiple_returns.py)**_  contains a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
+ [x] 9\. Find the max <br/>_**[9-max_integer.py](9-max_integer.py)**_  contains a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
+ [x] 10\. Only by 2 <br/>_**[10-divisible_by_2.py](10-divisible_by_2.py)**_  contains a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
+ [x] 11\. Delete at <br/>_**[11-delete_at.py](11-delete_at.py)**_  contains a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
+ [x] 12\. Switch <br/>_**[12-switch.py](12-switch.py)**_  switches the value of  two variables `a` and `b`.
+ [x] 13\. Linked list palindrome <br/>_**[13-is_palindrome.c](13-is_palindrome.c)**_  contains a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
+ [x] 14\. CPython #0: Python lists <br/>_**[100-print_python_list_info.c](100-print_python_list_info.c)**_  contains a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
